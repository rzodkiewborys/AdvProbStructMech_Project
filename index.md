## Schedule of the meetings

The project is conducted under the supervision of two teachers. Most meetings are held by Paweł Bielski, unless otherwise specified. Krzysztof Wołoszyk is the teacher responsible for the subject and the lectures.

PB: Paweł Bielski\
KW: Krzysztof Wołoszyk

1. 06-10.10.2025, PB/**KW** --- Proposal and confirmation of individual project topics

2. 20-24.10.2025, PB --- Working on the tasks

3. 17-21.11.2025, **KW** --- Mid-semester evaluation of the project progress (25 pts)

4. 01-05.12.2025, PB --- Working on the tasks

5. 12-16.01.2026, PB --- Working on the tasks

6. 26-30.01.2026, PB/**KW** --- Evaluation of the final project (25 pts), public presentations (20 pts)

## Course design

The course is held in an open format. Each student is encouraged to propose an individual project topic. The project should involve either (1) solving an advanced structural mechanics problem, or (2) developing a custom computational tool. The topic is not limited to any specific software. The task may be addressed using an FEM program (e.g. Femap), a programming language (Python, MATLAB, Scilab), or any other appropriate tool.

During the first week, students are expected to present a project plan consisting of:

1. A conceptual description of the problem,
2. The chosen software tools,
3. Criteria defining the final outcome.

The plan may be modified as the project develops. For the mid-semester evaluation, an updated version of the plan should be presented and approved by the teacher.

By the end of the semester, the final report should include:

1. A theoretical description of the problem,
2. Relevant drawings,
3. Description of the methods and/or functions,
4. Results and/or example computations,
5. A discussion on the applicability of the results or tool.

After approval by the teacher, the report must be publicly presented during the final meeting.

## Grading system

A maximum of 70 points can be obtained for the project part of the subject:

- **25 pts** --- Mid-semester evaluation of the project progress (KW),

- **25 pts** --- Successful completion of the project (PB),

- **20 pts** --- Final presentation of the project results (KW).

Progress is evaluated in person during the scheduled classes. The awarded points reflect the student’s progress at the given date and are generally not subject to revision.
